Thu Feb  4 11:40:50 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* doc/en/index.html:
	updated documentation

Wed Feb  3 22:43:32 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (KuickShow): 
	implemented deletion of files (delete/shift-delete/popupmenu)

	fixed quite a few buglets with keyboard navigation (pageUp didn't
	halt when a directory was found). pageUp/down and the like shall only
	select files.

	worked around kwm-bug (resize doesn't work properly after
	KWM::setDecoration( noDecoration )
	
Tue Dec 29 16:55:11 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickshow.cpp, imlibwidget.cpp, kfileview.*: 
	fixed updating of directory in statusbar and filenma ein caption of
 	imlibwidget

	fileview is prepared to support sorting and filtering

	added toggle showing hidden files (accessible via toolbar)

	added Home-Button in toolbar to change to home directory

Wed Nov 18 15:40:46 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (mouseMoveEvent): 

	fixed cursor not being reset to arrorCursor, when shift-key was
	released during resize ( == abort resizing )

Wed Nov 18 15:09:36 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (saveSettings): 

	size of the browserwindow is now saved and restored on next start

Mon Nov  9 23:16:32 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

        * hopefully fixed autoconf stuff, which was broken at least on SunOS
        Now tries to detect imlib-config and links against
        `imlib-config --libs`. If this doesn't work, it links against
        every graphics lib of libgif, libjpeg, libtiff and libpng, that
        is available.
        Another little bug is fixed, any changes (contrast/brightness/gamma)
        were not saved when using "save as"

Sat Nov  7 15:22:18 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp
	added changing of brightness, contrast and gamma via keyboard and popup menu
	added saving image
	the factor, how much brightness/contrast/gamma you change with one click is
	only editable in configfile, no dialog, yet.

Sat Nov  7 12:57:48 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4 (ac_imlib_config): 
	added some configure-stuff to use `imlib-config' to determine the libs
	to be linked against.

Sun Oct 11 23:58:46 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (loadImageInternal): 
	added configuration option to not override the color palette
	useful for 8bit displays

	* src/kuickshow.cpp:
	fixed segfault when imlib can't load image
	(don't preload the next image, then)

Wed Sep 30 19:39:15 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in:
	Added a configure-check for Imlib. Still incomplete (does NOT
	check for all those other libs as libgif, libjpeg, libz, ...),
	but at least finds libImlibs which are too old.

	src/kuickshow.cpp (about):
	about dialog is centered, now

Fri Sep 25 19:32:13 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (keyPressEvent): 
	Now behavior of scrolling/zooming with mouse is fixed:
	pressing left mousebutton and moving the mouse will move the image
	(only if it image is larger than current window)

	Pressing Shift, left mousebutton and moving the mouse will zoom into
	the image. Releasing Shift-button before mousebutton will abort zooming

Thu Sep 24 02:41:26 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (mouseReleaseEvent): 
	Ahh, finally I got "zoom inside image with mouse" working perfectly.
	A rectangle is painted and this rectangle is zoomed and centered.
	Not the very best solution, tho, as imlib is zooming the entire
	image, not only the selected part... guess how long it can take for
	bigger images.
	Gotta find another solution later, creating a new imlib image with
	just the selected part.

Tue Sep 22 21:05:58 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (preloadImage): 
	Added preloading facility. Fills the cache with the next image, so it
	will pop up almost instantaneously, when pressing PageUp/Down.
	Configurable via dialog.

Mon Sep 21 16:29:56 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (eventFilter): 
	Added "Enter-key", that reloads current image (so all zoom/move stuff
	is restored to original settings).

Sun Sep 20 19:04:23 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kfileview.cpp (prev): 
	whoops, fixed a segfault, when trying to get a kfileinfo of index -1.
	I shouldn't check, whether an unsigned int is smaller than 0, which it
	actually was. Now uses int.

Sun Sep 20 13:35:00 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (closeEvent): 
	reverted to override closeEvent() and changed every occurrence of
	close( true ) to close( false ), as closeEvent now explicitely 
	deletes itself.
	This was due to windowmanagers close-button, which should delete widget

Sun Sep 20 03:08:45 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (printImage): 
	added preliminary support for printing

Sat Sep 19 01:40:22 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (rotate): 
	added rotate-routine to - doh - rotate an image

Fri Sep 18 01:08:46 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (scrollImage): 
	Now changes cursor when attempting to move the image with the mouse
	Also, image can be moved now, when in window mode and window is
	larger than desktop

Thu Sep 17 17:25:11 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (setPopupMenu): 
	the fix for the popupmenu also let me finally delete it without
	segfault :o)

Thu Sep 17 13:13:09 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/kuickconfigdlg.cpp (KuickConfigDialog): 
	enlargened maxCache lineedit and changed tooltip

	* src/imlibconfig.cpp
	changed default value for maxCache from 0 to 10000 (10megs)

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (scrollImage): 
	restricted scrolling so that you can move the image only
	if it doesn't fit onto the screen.
	You can't move the image out of the screen anymore.

	Also fixed a segfault (ugh) in viewerMenu->popup(), as it was
	initialized in the wrong place (now in initImlib()).
	

Thu Sep 17 00:11:53 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (loadImage): 
	re-enabled Imlib_destroy_image()
	Found another value in imlib configuration struct, pixmapcachesize
	which I wasn't aware of. Now limiting imlib's cache really works :o))
	I'm really happy now :-) Running out of Ram and even Swap is not too
	funny ;o)

Tue Sep 15 20:28:49 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (centerImage): 
	fixed images not centering when larger than screen and in fullscreen
	mode.
	

Tue Sep 15 14:06:27 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (mouseMoveEvent): 
	scrolling the image with the mouse is now possible. Didn't expect
	scrolling would be so smooth :o)
	Also added a popupmenu (ImlibWidget::setPopupmenu( bool )) for
	the basic features like zoom and flip image

Mon Sep 14 16:20:30 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/fileview.cpp/.h
	* src/kfileview.cpp/.h
	* src/kuickshow.cpp
	added "change directory" possibility. A dialog asks for a directory
	and the fileview is being updated. Either accessible via the
	popupmenu, or via Ctrl-g (goto)

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (KuickShow): 
	once again optimized commandline parsing

Mon Sep 14 13:24:40 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

        * funny, I added lots of stuff, moved some other stuff around and
	the result is a binary about 30k smaller than before :-D

	* src/fileview.cpp (findCompletion): 
	*strike* now even filecompletion works :-) If you hit some keys
	on your keyboard, while in the filebrowser, a small edit window pops
	up in the bottom-right corner. Just type in the first chars of the
	filename of the image you want to see, and it will be highlighted.

	* src/kuickshow.cpp, src/imlibwidget.h/.cpp: 
	Cool. Now, I have only one ImlibData object, so I share imlib's
	cache between all open windows. This does not only speed things
	up quite a bit, but also reduced memory usage with multiple open
	windows.
	ImlibWidget therefore has a new constructor, where you can pass the
	pointer to the ImlibData object.

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (ImlibWidget): 
	now creates an ImlibConfig object itself, when none has been given
	in the contructor

Sun Sep 13 23:28:31 1998  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* src/imlibwidget.cpp (renderImage): 
	Don't destroy images ( Imlib_destroy_image() ) anymore. This boosts
	browsing a LOT. Showing cached images is almosts instantaneous now!
	Hope there's no sideeffect on this :-}

	* src/kuickshow.cpp (eventFilter): 
	space toggles show()ing and hide()ing the browser now.
	If started with image as parameter, kuickshow doesn't show
	the browser, hit space to show it.

	* src/fileview.h (class FileView): 
	findCompletion() is now public, so that I can tell the browser
	to highlight the file, supplied via commandline.
	

History:
--------
- found that xemacs can create much better changelogs :o)
- hacked a lot of goodies into KuickShow, several configuration options
- decided to have a look at the Xlib stuff and found out, how to map
  an Imlib image onto any QWidget - this is cool :o)
- too bad, it was not very reliable and it was a mess, too
- with my Xlib non-knowledge, found a way to "swallow" an Imlib image
  onto a QWidget - imagine how happy I was :o)
- if Kopacz got Imlib to work, I could do that, too :-P
- end of August 98, saw Adam Kopacz' release of qiv (quick image viewer)
  damn, this was my name (kiv, kuick image viewer) :o(
- first tries to use Imlib to display on Qt/KDE widgets in April 98,
  too bad, it didn't work :o(
- first hack of kview to use a filebrowser in January
- had the idea for such an app about December 97
