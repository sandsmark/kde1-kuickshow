KuickShow v0.5 by

-----------------------------------------------

KuickShow is a comfortable image browser/viewer. It displays a filebrowser
where you can select (doubleclick, Return-key or "view" in popupmenu) files
which are then shown.
Images can be displayed either in an own window, as large as the image,
or fullscreen. This is configurable in the options dialog.

The options dialog has some more possibilities:
- images can be automatically shrunk to fit onto the screen, if they are larger
- you can set the delay time for a slide show
- you can tell the browser which filetypes to show
- you can tweak the speed/quality ratio

Once an image is shown, you don't have to return to the filebrowser, to view
the next: just press "PageDown" to view the next image in the filebrowser.
"PageUp" gives you the previous one. Of course, "Home" and "End" bring you
to the first and last image.
Note, that the filebrowser always highlights the file, that you is actually
displayed.

You can display more than one image at a time, by selecting one image, and
another one, and one more, and ...
It will be more fun, if you are not in fullscreen mode, tho ;o)

If you look for a certain file, just enter the first characters of its
filename (in the browser). A small edit window pops up in the bottom-right
corner. Once a matching file is found, it is highlighted. Leave the
edit-window by pressing Return or Escape.


Keyboard shortcuts:
-------------------
Press "+" to zoom into the image, "-" to unzoom.
Press "*" to flip the image horizontally, "/" to flip it vertically
Press "7" to rotate the image 270 degrees clockwise ( = 90 degrees
          counterclockwise or "9" to rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
Use the arrow keys to move the image (or rather you, the viewer:
    e.g. left arrow moves you to the left -> the image is moved to the right)
BTW, have you tried moving the image around with the mouse? Just grab and move.
"Return" toggles between fullscreen and window mode.
"Space" shows/hides the filebrowser (you can only hide the browser, if an image
        is shown).
c,C give you more/less contrast on an image,
b/B more/less brightness,
g/G more/less gamma
Ctrl-s saves am image,
delete deletes an image, shift delete doesn't ask before deleting
Enter rerenders the image in original settings/size

Finally, "Esc" brings you back to the browser.
"Ctrl-g" - goto - in the filebrowser let's you quickly change the directory
without having to browse all the way to it.
Ctrl-q quits KuickShow

If you don't like those keybings, I'm gonna make them configurable, soon.

Commandline parameters:
-----------------------
You can pass KuickShow a commandline parameter:
start it as

kuickshow /home/user/images/bla.jpg

The image bla.jpg will be displayed and the browser will show you the 
directory contents of /home/user/images. The browser is hidden, until you hit
the space bar, tho.

If you just give a directory as commandline, e.g.

kuickshow /usr/local/images

it will just open that directory.
You can also drop images from kfm onto the image viewer (not the filebrowser).
