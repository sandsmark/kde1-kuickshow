- printing works, but is quite broken. Printed image are stretched to fully
  match the paper size which is not always what you want :-}

- filebrowser gives lots of asserts and flickers.
  This is because of old kdelibs, it's already fixed in current KDE 1.1 snap

- somehow, the fullscreen mode doesn't work correctly, when kwm is in
  "ShapeMode", i.e. using shaped windows from some theme.
  fullscreen mode apparently doesn't work correctly with other windowmanagers

- you can't browse multiple directories (via pageUp/down...) by opening
  more than one image window
